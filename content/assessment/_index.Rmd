  <p>We will cover several case studies where data was successfully deanonymised. You must explain some of these case studies in the assessment.</p>
  <p>The code portion of the coursework will require you to work with a survey dataset. You will need to clean, wrangle and visualise the survey data.</p>",
  "<p>The written sections of the coursework will require you to discuss the roles of <em>fairness, accountability, and transparency</em> in algorithm development and application.</p>
  <p>We will cover several case studies about algorithm \"fairness\" and applications. You must explain some of these case studies in the assessment.</p>
  <p>We will also discuss several statistical/data science topics: hypothesis testing, supervised vs unsupervised learning and regression. <b>You will not need to perform any statistical modelling or testing in the coursework</b>.</p>
  <p>The code portion of the coursework <b>does not include any material from this section</b>.</p>",
  "<p>The written section of the coursework for this section must be written in RMarkdown. All other written sections are to be answered in Word documents</p>
  <p>You will be supplied a dataset from a specific publication for the asssessment.</p>
  <p>The code portion of the assessment wil require you to clean, wrangle and visualise data from a healthcare survey.</p>",
  "<p>This section is <b>not assessed in the written or coding section of the coursework</b></p>
  <p>These sections are important because they will help you understand how to apply your knowledge in the next phase of your career - or how to solve problems outside of carefully designed assessment criteria.</p>"
