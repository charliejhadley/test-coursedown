Hello folks!

I'm a Visiting Lecturer at BCU. Most of my time is spent as an independent data science consultant and trainer. My company website provides a [full overview of my research and career history](https://www.visibledata.co.uk/about.html).

My background is in solid state physics and biomineralisation. I briefly worked at University of Birmingham where I published on the precipitation of magnetic nanoparticles and the characterisation of hydroxyapatite substrates. Between 2012 and 2015 I worked as a senior consultant at Wolfram Research. I piloted and launched the [Interactive Data Network](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk) at University of Oxford between 2015 and 2019.
