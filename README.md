# Introduction to Principles and Approaches of Data Science for Healthcare Applications

This is a Masters module from the [Medical Engineering Applications for
Healthcare](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/medical-engineering-msc-2022-23)
programme at Birmingham City University.

The course primarily covers four topics:

-   Using R for reproducible research and data visualisation.

-   Open data: it’s applications and ethical considerations.

-   Data anonymisation: how to approach it and the dangers of what
    happens when data can be deanonymised.

-   Algorithms in healthcare: ethical considerations and case studies
    where things have gone wrong.

This repository will contain all lecture slides and assessment
materials. But it’s currently in a very draft format.

This module is being taught for the first time September 2022. Assuming
the course continues into the future each edition of the course will be
given a distinct GitHub Release

# Where this course fits in the R community

The R community is rich, vibrant and extremely awesome. In my own
learning of R I am indebted to the free work and support provided by
many individuals and groups. In building this course there are two
resources I would like to particularly highlight.

## Course Website

[This courses uses the excellent {coursedown}
package](https://github.com/BBieri/coursedown) - which is a (highly)
customised {blogdown} template. I’m very grateful to [Bernhard
Bieri](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5943-9059) for taking the time to
build this template.

The colour scheme used was generated from <http://colormind.io/>

## Andrew Heiss’ courses

[Andrew Heiss](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3948-3914) has been using
{blogdown} to build awesome course websites for over half a decade. His
courses are brilliant both [from a technical point of
view](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2020/01/10/makefile-subdirectory-zips/)
and pedagogical approach. Andrew’s work is also partyl the inspiration
for the {coursedown} package.

Many of the materials in this course are inspired and informed by
Andrew’s work.

## PsyTeachR

The [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/) team at University of
Glasgow have built an excellent collection of 10+ books on reproducible
research methods, skills and more. I learned about PsyTeachR through
[Lisa DeBruine’s](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7523-5539) [frequent and
helpful insights through discussions on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/LisaDeBruine/status/1522598941866536960?s=20&t=V5FV6qaakC4DWcrOSqWYCw).

Many of the materials in this course are inspired and informed by the
work at PsyTeachR
